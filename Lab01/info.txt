potential classes:
server
customer
waiting queue (?) -> inside server
events
Global event handler -> can have: event queue(?) 

(You can change some of them to java collection framework like queue to avoid the need to implement everything)

There must be a Simulator.java

You must not change the Main.java -> Do not change thing in
Simulator.java that main needs
